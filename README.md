# Feature Engineering & Feature Selection


## Motivation
Feature Engineering & Selection is the most essential part of building a useable machine learning project, even though hundreds of cutting-edge machine
learning algorithms coming in these days like deep learning and transfer learning

## Feature Selection
Feature selection is the process of identifying and selecting a subset of features from the original data set to use as inputs in a machine learning algorithm.
<br/>
Data sets usually contain a large number of features. We can use multiple algorithms to quickly disregard irrelevant features and identify those important features in our data.
<br/>
Feature selection algorithms can be divided into 1 of 3 categories: <br/>
filter methods, wrapper methods, and embedded methods.
